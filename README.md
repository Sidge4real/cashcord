## ðŸ’¼ Project

This project was made for [AP highschool](https://www.ap.be/en/homepage) (Antwerp/Belguim), for our end presentation of our first year.
Our presentation powerpoint can be [viewed here](https://github.com/Sidge4real/cashcord/blob/main/docs/Presentatie.ppsx). This read-only. Click above right on the download icon to see the powerpoint. This is in Dutch written.

## ðŸš€ Technologies

**Node**:
Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript outside the browser. With Node.js, you can build and run server-side applications, which means you can use JavaScript to implement the server logic of your web application.

**TypeScript**:
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It provides improved error detection and tooling support during the development of your web application. TypeScript code needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can be executed.

**Express**:
Express is a minimalist and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications, including routing URLs, defining routes, handling HTTP requests, and generating HTTP responses.

**MongoDB**:
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents and offers powerful querying and indexing capabilities. In a web application, MongoDB can be used as a database to store user data, project information, and company data.

**API JSON**:
An API (Application Programming Interface) defines how different components of a software application can communicate with each other. In this case, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is used as the format for communication between the frontend and backend of the web application. JSON is a lightweight data model that can be easily read and written by both humans and computers.

**HTML/CSS/JS**:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JS (JavaScript) are the fundamental building blocks of a web page. HTML is used for structuring the content, CSS is used for styling and layout of the page, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web page. These technologies are used to implement the frontend of the web application, including displaying the login page, project overviews, and comparison features.

**EJS**:
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine for Node.js. It allows you to create dynamic web pages by combining HTML with JavaScript code. With EJS, you can create reusable templates for generating HTML output based on data from the backend. In this case, EJS can be used to generate dynamic content such as displaying project data and company information based on the logged-in user.

_These are some of the key technologies that can be used in a web application where users need to log in, start/view projects, and compare companies._
